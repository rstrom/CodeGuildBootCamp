## Assignment: Photo Album
For this assignment you will create a photo album / gallery webpage. When a user clicks on a photo it should blow up into a full window zoom with a "light box" effect (the rest of the page should be shaded over). If a user presses right or left it should advance or go back in the photo album. Make it slick.

Ingredients:
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* any third party libraries you might find

Bonus points: push to GitHub with a `gh-pages` branch  
Challenge: don't use jQuery, Bootstrap or any 3rd party libs
