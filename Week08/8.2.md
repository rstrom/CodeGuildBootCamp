## Assignment: JSON-based Photo Album
Make your photo album completely dynamic! Instead of specifying our image src urls inside of our HTML markup we will use a separate `photos.json` file to keep track of the images in our album. You will need to load `photos.json` in your JavaScript code and dynamically generate the relevant `img` elements.
