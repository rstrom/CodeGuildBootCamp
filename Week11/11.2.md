## Django one to one model relationships
We are going to create a UserProfile model with a [one-to-one](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/db/examples/one_to_one/) relationship to the `django.contrib.auth` `User` model.

The `UserProfile` model will have the folowing fields:
* `user` `OneToOneField` of the `User` model with unique set to true
* `picture` `URLField`

In addition we will update the `author` field of our `MicroPost` class so that is a `ForeignKey` of our new `UserProfile` model
