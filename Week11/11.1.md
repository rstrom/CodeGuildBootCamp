## Django microblog model relationships
For reference see: [Examples of model relationship API usage](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/db/examples/)

We are going modify our models as follows:
* new Tag model
  * name SlugField with unique set to True
* new MicroPost fields
  * author User [ForeignKey](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/db/examples/one_to_one/) (many-to-one relationship)
  * tags Tag [ManyToManyField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/db/examples/many_to_many/)

## Work: create a tag view
Create a view function to return posts by tag. Optional: add a template, CSS etc.
