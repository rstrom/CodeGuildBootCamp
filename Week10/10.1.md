# Evening 10.1

## Django Model Testing
See: [Writing and running test](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/testing/overview/)
We will write tests to cover the basic CRUD operations of interacting with our models:
* *create* new model instances in the TestCase setUp method
* *read* back out the model instances we've created
  * test that attempting to read a nonexistent instance raises a `<model>.DoesNotExist` exception using a context manager
* *update* our model instances
  * use `<instance>.refresh_from_db` to test that our instance has updated
* *delete* an instance of our model
  * check that it raise a `<model>.DoesNotExist` exception
