## To Do Continued
* update the ToDo model to include
  * user field
  * date_created field
* make and apply the resulting migrations
* resolve any discrepancies between the model and your database

## View Review
* write view functions to create, read, update and delete todo items
  * POST `todo/` create new todo
  * GET `todo/` list all todos
  * GET `todo/<id>/` view todo with primary key `<id>`
  * PUT `todo/<id>/` update todo with primary key `<id>`
  * DELETE `todo/<id>` delete todo with primary key `<id>`
* make sure to utilize the [@login_required](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required) decorator function to limit who can create, update or delete todo items

### Next Steps
Implement testing and user login / logout forms
